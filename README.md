I build full-stack Swift applications, bridging the gap between iOS and server-side development. My focus is on clean
architecture, sleek interfaces, and meticulous attention to detail: Both in code and user experience.

## ðŸ’¼ What I'm Building

I develop and maintain a bitcoin price tracking application at [@btcreport](https://github.com/btcreport), where
precision meets beautiful design. My work combines real-time data handling with interfaces that users actually enjoy
using.

## ðŸ”¨ Current Challenge

I'm modernizing a 10+ year old codebase, bringing it into the present while maintaining its stability. This includes:

- Supporting modern device screens (beyond the iPhone 5 era)
- Integrating contemporary platform APIs
- Refactoring legacy Objective-C patterns while preserving battle-tested logic

It's the kind of real-world engineering challenge that teaches you as much about software evolution as it does about
Swift.

## ðŸŽ¯ My Philosophy

Quality code is about more than just making things work. I believe in:

- **Clean Architecture** â€“ Code that's maintainable, testable, and makes sense six months later
- **Thoughtful UX** â€“ Every interaction should feel intentional and polished
- **Attention to Detail** â€“ From variable naming to animation curves, the details matter
